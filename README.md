#Nive Angular Example App
A basic app showcasing the usage of [AngularNive](https://github.com/nive/notepad_angular).

##Features
* User authentication
* CRUD of Data Objects (Notes)
* User profile & password change
* Basic service error handling

It also comes with a mock-backend simulating Nive-Service API responses. This can be used for evaluating, development and testing purposes. See comments in [index.html](https://github.com/nive/notepad_angular/blob/master/index.html) for usage.

###Please Note
For demonstration purposes, this app is very simplified. Especially authentication and code-structure should be more sophisticated for production ready apps.
